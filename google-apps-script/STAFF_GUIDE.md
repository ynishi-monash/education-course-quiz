2. Find the question you want to change
3. Click on the **text** column and edit directly
4. Changes appear immediately in the quiz

- To "üå± Young children (0‚Äì12)"

### üí¨ Modifying Feedback Messages

Feedback appears after students select an answer to encourage and inform them.

2. Find the option you want to add/edit feedback for
3. Edit these columns:
   - **feedbackIcon**: Emoji that appears large (usually same as in label)
   - **feedbackTitle**: Personal title - always use {name} for the student's name
   - **feedbackMessage**: Informative, encouraging message

**Example Feedback**:

- **Message**: "Early childhood education is incredibly rewarding! 85% of graduates report high job satisfaction."

### üîó Changing Question Flow

The **nextId** column controls where students go after selecting an answer.

**Question IDs** (go to another question):
- q_age_group
- q_primary_path  
- q_ps_hpe
- q_ps_inclusion
- q_secondary_area

**Outcome IDs** (end with a result - must start with "out_"):
- out_early_primary
- out_primary_double
- out_primary_single
- out_ps_hpe
- out_ps_inclusive
- out_ps_general

1. Go to the **Options** sheet
2. Find the last row for the question you want to add to
3. Insert a new row below it
4. Fill in columns (optionId now auto-generated!):
   - **questionId**: Same as the question you're adding to
   - **label**: Text with emoji for the button
   - **nextId**: Where this option leads
   - **Feedback columns**: Optional but recommended

**‚ú® No more optionId needed!** The system automatically creates IDs like "opt1", "opt2", "opt3" for each question.

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do's

- **Always test your changes** by taking the quiz after editing
- **Use encouraging, positive language** in feedback messages
- **Keep answer labels short and clear** (they appear on buttons)
- **Include relevant emojis** to make options visually appealing
- **Use {name} in feedback titles** to personalize messages
- **Save your work frequently** (Google Sheets auto-saves)

### ‚ùå Don'ts

- **Don't change question IDs** - this breaks the quiz flow (option IDs are auto-generated now!)
- **Don't leave nextId empty** for working options
- **Don't use commas in IDs** (use underscores instead)
- **Don't change the Meta sheet** without consulting technical team
- **Don't delete entire rows** unless you're sure they're unused

## Testing Your Changes

After making edits:

1. **Save the spreadsheet** (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
2. **Check the Overview sheet** to verify your changes look correct
3. **Look for error highlighting** - red backgrounds indicate problems that need fixing
4. **Open the quiz application** in a new browser tab
5. **Navigate to the question you changed**
6. **Verify your changes appear correctly**
7. **Test the complete path** to ensure navigation still works
8. **Check feedback messages** display as expected

### üîç Enhanced Error Detection

The enhanced system will:
- **Highlight invalid references** in red (like broken nextId links)
- **Show missing feedback** in yellow (optional but recommended)
- **Group related options** with color coding
- **Display helper text** to prevent common mistakes
- **Validate dropdown selections** to prevent typos

## Troubleshooting

### "My changes don't appear in the quiz"

- Wait a few seconds and refresh the quiz page
- Check you edited the correct sheet
- Ensure you saved the spreadsheet
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5)

### "The quiz gets stuck on a question"

- Check the **nextId** values in the Options sheet
- Make sure they reference valid question IDs or outcome IDs
- Verify there are no typos in the nextId column

### "Feedback doesn't show"

- Some questions don't have feedback (like simple yes/no questions)
- Check that feedback columns aren't empty
- Verify feedbackIcon, feedbackTitle, or feedbackMessage have content

### "A question option is missing"

- Check the Options sheet for the questionId
- Ensure the option row isn't hidden or filtered
- Verify all required columns have data

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check this guide first** for common solutions
2. **Ask a colleague** to review your changes
3. **Contact the technical team** with:
